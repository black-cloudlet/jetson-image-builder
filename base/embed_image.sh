# Images land in /usr/lib/containers-image-cache/<sha of reference> and
# mapping.txt records reference -> sha. copy_embedded_images.sh replays that
# into containers-storage at boot. A separate cache directory is used rather
# than /usr/lib/containers/storage because an image upgrade overwrites an
# additional container store (RHEL-75827).

# The same reference arriving twice is a second copy of every blob, and if the
# first copy was made in a lower layer both of them ship in the image: the write
# is a copy-up, and overlay keeps what it copied from. Callers build their lists
# by concatenation — release-info plus the manifest scan, that scan plus
# SERVICE_IMAGES — and none of them dedupe across the seam, so the embed is
# idempotent here rather than in each caller. Keyed on manifest.json because
# skopeo writes it after the blobs: a copy interrupted half way leaves the
# directory behind but not that file, and is redone rather than trusted.
